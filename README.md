## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info: Frequently Asked Questions

**ü§î What is a Standalone Word?**
A standalone word is a word that is not part of another word. For example, if you have the standalone word `fort` in your standalone filter list, the word `forts` will not be flagged.

**‚ùì What is a Phrase?**
A phrase refers to any text that consists of more than a single word. With Chat Control, you can target and filter out entire phrases to maintain the desired environment on your server.

**üî† How do Replacement Letters Work?**
Replacement letters are letters that are substituted before the message is filtered. For example, if you set a replacement of `1` with `i`, any occurrence of the number one will be replaced with the letter i before the message is filtered. This feature enhances the accuracy of your filtering system.

**‚öôÔ∏è I Already Have Another Mod with a Mute Command. How Can I Prevent Conflict?**
No worries! You can easily disable the mute command in the Chat Control configuration file located at `config/chatcontrol.json` in your server folder. Simply set the `muteCommand` option to false, and after restarting the server, you won't encounter any conflicts.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that Chat Control is currently available exclusively for Fabric. We do not have plans to create a Forge version at the moment.
